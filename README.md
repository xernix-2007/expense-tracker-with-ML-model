# expense-tracker-with-ML-model
This project is a simple Python command-line tool that helps you:
1.Record daily expenses
2.View your spending history
3.Predict future expenses using a basic machine-learning model (Linear Regression)
It stores data in a CSV file so your records stay saved even after closing the program.
